Scratch Repo
============

This repo is intended to be a playground or start point for working with Node JS.

To get started run the following command in your terminal

```sh
npx degit gregdaynes/scratch my-scratch-app
```

__replace my-scratch-app with a folder name to download the files to__

In the new directory, run

```sh
npm run setup
```

This will setup git hooks, and make a copy of the example .env file.
